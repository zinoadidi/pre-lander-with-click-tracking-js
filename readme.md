### Pre-Lander click id tracker task

- See index.md for task description

<br/>
Solution is made in index.html and clicktracker.js and focuses mainly on the functionality as the sample page already contains the design. Design however can be done if made compulsory
<br/>
It is assumed that no edge cases should be considered when implementing the solution such as obfuscating the script, supporting old browsers or handling broken link. 
<br/>I have added check for ensuring it picks the click id even if there are multiple parameters. 
support for older browsers can be discussed if this is required and code can be simplified to use older js API's.

### Design Aspect
#### CSS 
For my design i used a small css library and added new styles based on what i wanted.
All CSS can be custom written as well if / when needed but since the css framework is opensource, i was able to extract just the portion of css that was needed, this is one way to minimize loading time while keeping the speed and efficiency the frameworks provide.

#### Concept
Keeping things simple is the watch word for these kinds of pages, hence i made a two column design, one side with lightweight / colorful graphical content which still conveys the message as user can lose focus when its just plain text, its also a kind of click bait which is properly laced with the offer link as well.
<br/>I included images and colors from the landing page to bring the designs closer to each other; this way users have a false sense of togetherness and feel like all the pages are one
<br/>I kept the text in the copy.md file, as it seems the tester wanted it to be shown in the different sizes it was made available in.
<br/> I also improved the design to cater for mobile users as well and give a slightly different design to them to ensure that its easy to access the offer buttons
<br/> Code can be improved further mostly for speed, and some css can be simplified
images could be in base64 format or as background images.
<br/>
If needed we can have more discussion on this topic to clarify the details.
