### Pre-Lander click id tracker task

- See index.md for task description

<br/>
Solution is made in index.html and clicktracker.js and focuses mainly on the functionality as the sample page already contains the design. Design however can be done if made compulsory
<br/>
It is assumed that no edge cases should be considered when implementing the solution such as obfuscating the script, supporting old browsers or handling broken link. 
<br/>I have added check for ensuring it picks the click id even if there are multiple parameters. 
support for older browsers can be discussed if this is required and code can be simplified to use older js API's.
